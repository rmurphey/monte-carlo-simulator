# Design Documents

This directory contains formal feature design documentation for the agent-friendly Monte Carlo simulation framework.

## Purpose

Design documents support large team coordination by:
- Defining requirements and technical architecture before implementation
- Establishing agent workflow patterns and optimization strategies  
- Creating measurable success criteria and testing approaches
- Documenting integration patterns with existing framework components

## Active Designs

### [Interactive Definition Builder](interactive-definition-builder.md)
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Priority:** High  
**Scope:** Major UX Feature

Comprehensive design for guided simulation creation workflow optimized for AI agents. Enables sophisticated simulation generation through interactive prompts with real-time validation.

**Key Features:**
- Agent-friendly workflow patterns
- Business intelligence template integration  
- Real-time validation and preview capabilities
- Performance and scalability considerations

### [Interactive Parameter Exploration](interactive-parameter-exploration.md)
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Priority:** High  
**Scope:** Core Workflow Feature

Implementation of the `--interactive` flag for real-time parameter adjustment during simulation execution, enabling the core exploration workflow documented in the agent beginner guide.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time parameter modification
- Progress comparison between runs
- Professional UI with inquirer prompts
- Seamless workflow integration

### [Documentation Sync System](documentation-sync-system.md)  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Scope:** Quality Assurance

Critical system to prevent documentation drift and ensure examples remain working and current with codebase changes.

**Key Features:**
- Automated documentation validation
- Example testing integration
- Development workflow enhancement
- Quality assurance automation

## Design Review Process

1. **Create Design**: Document requirements, architecture, and implementation plan
2. **Stakeholder Review**: Review technical approach and business alignment
3. **Implementation Planning**: Break design into actionable development tasks
4. **Development**: Implement following design specifications
5. **Validation**: Verify implementation meets design success criteria

## Template Structure

Each design document includes:
- **Problem Statement**: Clear definition of feature need
- **User Stories**: Agent-focused requirements with acceptance criteria
- **Technical Design**: Architecture, APIs, and integration patterns
- **Agent Experience**: Workflow optimization and guidance strategy
- **Implementation Plan**: Phases, testing, and timeline
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes and validation approach

## Integration

Design documents are referenced from:
- `ACTIVE_WORK.md` for current priorities
- Implementation task lists and todo tracking
- Development milestone planning
- Architecture decision records
