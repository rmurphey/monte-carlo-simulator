# Archive Directory

This directory contains completed designs, implementations, and development insights for the Monte Carlo Simulation Framework.

## Archive Structure

### Core Development Phases
- **[COMPLETED_WORK.md](COMPLETED_WORK.md)** - Original framework foundation, web interface, and CLI infrastructure
- **[business-intelligence-transformation.md](business-intelligence-transformation.md)** - Complete transformation to business intelligence platform with ARR framework
- **[cli-simulation-generator-completed.md](cli-simulation-generator-completed.md)** - YAML-based simulation creation system

### Development Timeline

#### Phase 1: Framework Foundation ✅
*Archived in: COMPLETED_WORK.md*
- MonteCarloEngine, ParameterSchema, SimulationRegistry core infrastructure
- React web interface with dynamic forms and visualizations
- Interactive CLI with configuration builder
- Comprehensive test coverage (58+ tests)

#### Phase 2: Business Intelligence Transformation ✅  
*Archived in: business-intelligence-transformation.md*
- Universal ARR-based budgeting framework
- Professional CLI with colorized output and scenario comparison
- Industry-standard KPIs (restaurant, marketing, software development)
- Validated business scenarios with realistic parameters

#### Phase 3: Configuration-Driven Creation ✅
*Archived in: cli-simulation-generator-completed.md*
- YAML-based simulation creation without TypeScript knowledge
- Interactive configuration builder with step-by-step guidance
- Runtime execution engine with sandboxed JavaScript logic
- AI-friendly schema for automated simulation generation

## Key Insights Preserved

### Architectural Patterns
- **Universal Business Context**: ARR framework eliminates parameter duplication
- **Configuration > Code Generation**: Runtime YAML execution more flexible than generated code
- **Industry Validation**: Real business metrics more valuable than academic outputs
- **Professional UX**: Terminal interface quality impacts executive adoption

### High-ROI Development Strategies
- Business context first (ARR framework as foundation)
- Industry templates for immediate utility
- Interactive guidance reduces user errors
- Professional CLI essential for business adoption

### Technical Achievements
- Production-ready business intelligence platform
- 58+ comprehensive tests with business logic validation
- Universal ARR framework working across all simulation types
- Configuration-driven approach democratizing simulation creation
