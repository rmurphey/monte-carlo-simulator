### üéØ **Current Phase: Agent-Friendly Conversational Simulation Generation**

**Strategic Vision: Transform business questions into Monte Carlo simulations through AI agent conversation**

- ‚úÖ Universal ARR injection system implemented
- ‚úÖ Professional CLI with industry-standard KPIs  
- ‚úÖ Interactive CLI Enhancement Phase 1 - Business templates and contextual guidance
- ‚úÖ BaseSimulation inheritance architecture designed

**Next Strategic Priorities:**

1. **Config-Driven Simulation Framework (Highest Priority)** - [Design Doc](designs/agent-friendly-config-driven-framework.md)
   - [ ] **Enhanced YAML Schema** - Rich parameter definitions with business context and relationships
   - [ ] **Formula Evaluation Engine** - Declarative business logic in YAML with built-in functions  
   - [ ] **Code Escape Hatches** - Seamless TypeScript integration for complex calculations
   - [ ] **Agent Helper Patterns** - Standardized configuration patterns for common business questions

2. **Conversational Simulation Generation (High Priority)** - [Design Doc](designs/conversational-monte-carlo-generation.md)
   - [ ] **Question-to-Config Pipeline** - Transform strategic questions into simulation parameters
   - [ ] **Business Function Library** - Extensive pre-built functions for agent use (NPV, ROI, growth modeling)
   - [ ] **Agent Integration Examples** - Claude Code integration patterns and workflows
   - [ ] **Rapid Refinement System** - Interactive parameter adjustment through conversation

3. **Strategic Decision Support (Medium Priority)**
   - [ ] **Complex Business Questions** - "When does generative AI cost outweigh benefits?" type scenarios
   - [ ] **Technology Investment Analysis** - AI adoption, architecture decisions, tool evaluations
   - [ ] **Resource Planning Models** - Team scaling, budget allocation, timeline optimization
   - [ ] **Industry Benchmark Integration** - Real-world data for parameter validation

### Success Criteria
- **<5 minutes**: AI agent generates working simulation from strategic question
- **90% config-driven**: Simulations created through YAML without custom code
- **Strategic relevance**: Results influence real CTO-level decisions
- **Agent-optimized**: Claude Code (and other agents) can rapidly create simulations

## Business Intelligence Achievements

### üìä **Real Business Impact**
The platform now provides **actionable strategic intelligence** for:

**Marketing Optimization:**
- Budget allocation based on ARR capacity ($80K‚Üí$900K budgets)
- CAC efficiency analysis (cost per acquisition: $90‚Üí$34 with scale)
- Organic growth amplification tracking (viral coefficient modeling)
- ROI projections: 77%‚Üí4,943% across risk scenarios

**Restaurant Operations:**
- Cost control management (food: 28.6%, labor: 72.5% of revenue)
- Operational efficiency (table turns: 1.94 vs 2.0 target)
- Customer acquisition ($2.20 CAC with $2K monthly marketing budget)
- Capacity optimization ($546 revenue per seat per month)

**Software Development:**
- Feature delivery planning (0.4‚Üí1.1 features per developer per week)
- Team scaling efficiency with coordination overhead modeling
- Risk-adjusted timeline estimation with business-friendly metrics

### üéØ **Professional Features**
- **Rich Terminal UI**: Color-coded output with progress visualization
- **Scenario Risk Analysis**: Conservative/neutral/aggressive business planning
- **Industry Benchmarking**: Real KPIs that businesses actually track
- **Comparative Intelligence**: Side-by-side scenario analysis with statistical confidence

## Agent Integration Examples

**Current Working Commands:**
```bash
# Traditional scenario execution (still supported)
npm run cli -- run restaurant-profitability --scenario conservative --iterations 100
npm run cli -- run marketing-campaign-roi --compare conservative,aggressive --output comparison.json
```

**Future Agent Workflow:**
```typescript
// AI agent (like Claude Code) creates config-driven simulation
const question = "When does generative AI cost outweigh benefits?"
const config = await generateSimulationConfig(question, businessContext)
const results = await executeSimulation(config)

// Agent refines through conversation
const refinedConfig = await refineSimulation(config, userFeedback)
const updatedResults = await executeSimulation(refinedConfig)
```

**Target Agent Experience:**
```yaml
# Agent-generated YAML config for strategic question
name: "Generative AI Cost-Benefit Analysis"
patternType: "costBenefit"
timeHorizon: 24

costs:
  aiToolCosts: "teamSize * costPerDev * (1 + growthRate)^(month/12)"
benefits:  
  productivityGains: "teamSize * avgSalary * gainPercent * exp(-month * decayRate)"
  
outputs:
  breakEvenMonth: "findRoot(benefits - costs, 0, 60)"
  twelveMonthROI: "((sum(benefits, 0, 12) - sum(costs, 0, 12)) / sum(costs, 0, 12)) * 100"
```

## Strategic Vision: Agent-Powered Decision Support

The framework is transforming into an **AI agent-optimized platform** for strategic decision-making:

**Current Capabilities:**
- **Professional Business Intelligence**: Industry-standard KPIs and metrics
- **Rich Simulation Framework**: 58 passing tests, enterprise-grade quality
- **Interactive CLI**: Colorized output, scenario comparisons, export capabilities

**Target Capabilities:**
