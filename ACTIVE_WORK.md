- âœ… **Professional CLI with colorized terminal output and progress bars**
- âœ… **Comprehensive scenario comparison system (conservative/neutral/aggressive)**
- âœ… **Business-realistic metrics and industry-standard KPIs**
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation for AI tools like Claude Code
- âœ… 58 passing tests with strict TypeScript compliance

## Current Priority: Complete Business Intelligence Enhancement

### âœ… **Recently Completed: Professional Business Intelligence**

**CLI Run Command Framework:**

- âœ… Real-time progress bars and statistical displays
- âœ… Scenario comparison mode with detailed analysis
- âœ… Multiple output formats (table, JSON, CSV, quiet)
- âœ… Parameter override system and custom YAML file support

**Marketing Campaign ROI Intelligence:**
- âœ… ARR-based budgeting ($1Mâ†’$5M ARR with 8%â†’18% marketing spend)
- âœ… Comprehensive CAC modeling including sales costs and organic growth
- âœ… CAC:CLV ratio analysis for sustainability metrics (0.04â†’0.26 across scenarios)
- âœ… Viral/referral growth modeling (15%â†’25% organic conversion rates)

**Restaurant Profitability Intelligence:**
- âœ… Industry-standard KPIs: food cost %, labor cost %, table turnover rates
- âœ… Target-based management (28% food cost target vs actual achievement)
- âœ… Customer acquisition cost and operational efficiency tracking
- âœ… Seasonal variation modeling for realistic business cycles
- âœ… Revenue per seat and capacity utilization benchmarks

**Software Project Timeline Intelligence:**
- âœ… Business-friendly feature counts (replacing academic story points)
- âœ… Realistic team coordination overhead and scaling factors
- âœ… Velocity tracking with business-meaningful metrics

### ðŸŽ¯ **Current Phase: Framework Maturity & Scale**

**Core ARR Business Intelligence Framework: Complete âœ…**
- âœ… Universal ARR injection system implemented
- âœ… Automatic business context for all simulations
- âœ… Professional CLI with industry-standard KPIs

**Next Strategic Priorities:**

1. **Interactive CLI Enhancement (High Priority)** - [Design Doc](designs/interactive-cli-enhancement.md)
   - [ ] **Phase 1: Industry Templates** - Create 5-6 production-ready business scenario templates
   - [ ] **Phase 1: Business Guidance** - Add contextual help and parameter suggestions
   - [ ] **Phase 2: Enhanced Logic** - Pattern-based simulation logic generation with business formulas
   - [ ] **Phase 2: ARR Integration** - Automatic business scenario detection and ARR injection prompts

2. **Framework Architecture (High Priority)**
   - [ ] Implement BaseSimulation inheritance system
   - [ ] Create DRY architecture for scenario management
   - [ ] Reduce code duplication (~57% reduction potential)
   - [ ] Enable rapid creation of new business scenarios

3. **Comprehensive Validation (Medium Priority)**
   - [x] Test ARR framework across all simulation types
   - [ ] Validate business intelligence outputs against industry benchmarks
   - [ ] Ensure scenario comparisons provide actionable strategic insights
   - [ ] Create automated test suite for business logic validation

4. **Documentation & Scalability (Medium Priority)**
   - [ ] Document ARR business context system
   - [ ] Create framework extension guide for new simulation types
   - [ ] Establish patterns for industry-specific KPI modeling

### Success Criteria
- **Proven Business Intelligence**: All scenarios produce validated, actionable insights
- **Maintainable Codebase**: DRY architecture with clear inheritance patterns
- **Scalable Framework**: Easy creation of new simulation types with automatic ARR integration

## Business Intelligence Achievements

### ðŸ“Š **Real Business Impact**
The platform now provides **actionable strategic intelligence** for:

**Marketing Optimization:**
- Budget allocation based on ARR capacity ($80Kâ†’$900K budgets)
- CAC efficiency analysis (cost per acquisition: $90â†’$34 with scale)
- Organic growth amplification tracking (viral coefficient modeling)
- ROI projections: 77%â†’4,943% across risk scenarios

**Restaurant Operations:**
- Cost control management (food: 28.6%, labor: 72.5% of revenue)
- Operational efficiency (table turns: 1.94 vs 2.0 target)
- Customer acquisition ($2.20 CAC with $2K monthly marketing budget)
- Capacity optimization ($546 revenue per seat per month)

**Software Development:**
- Feature delivery planning (0.4â†’1.1 features per developer per week)
- Team scaling efficiency with coordination overhead modeling
- Risk-adjusted timeline estimation with business-friendly metrics

### ðŸŽ¯ **Professional Features**
- **Rich Terminal UI**: Color-coded output with progress visualization
- **Scenario Risk Analysis**: Conservative/neutral/aggressive business planning
- **Industry Benchmarking**: Real KPIs that businesses actually track
- **Comparative Intelligence**: Side-by-side scenario analysis with statistical confidence

## Current Working Commands

```bash
# Run individual scenarios with industry KPIs
npm run cli -- run restaurant-profitability --scenario conservative --iterations 100
npm run cli -- run marketing-campaign-roi --scenario aggressive --verbose

# Compare business scenarios with colorized output  
npm run cli -- run restaurant-profitability --compare conservative,neutral,aggressive
npm run cli -- run marketing-campaign-roi --compare conservative,aggressive --output comparison.json

# Override parameters for what-if analysis
npm run cli -- run restaurant-profitability --scenario conservative --seatingCapacity 80 --averageTicket 40

# Export results for business reporting
npm run cli -- run marketing-campaign-roi --scenario neutral --format csv --output marketing-analysis.csv
```
