# Active Work - Monte Carlo Simulation Framework

## Project Status
- **Quality**: Production-ready with bulletproof validation
- **Tests**: All tests passing
- **Templates**: 13 working simulation templates, all schema-validated
- **NPM Published**: Available via `npx monte-carlo-simulator`
- **Distribution**: Clean npm package, no build artifacts in git
- **Date**: 2025-08-13

## Current Priorities

### ðŸš€ **Strategic Enhancement Implementation**
Four strategic plans ready for implementation prioritization:

1. **[Natural Language Simulation Generator](plans/natural-language-simulation-generator.md)**
   - Generate simulations from business questions
   - Eliminate YAML expertise requirement
   - Timeline: 10-14 weeks

2. **[Enhanced Comparison Engine](plans/enhanced-comparison-engine.md)**
   - Multi-scenario statistical analysis 
   - Risk assessment and confidence intervals
   - Timeline: 13-17 weeks

3. **[Business Template Wizard](plans/business-template-wizard.md)**
   - Industry-specific templates with guided workflows
   - Benchmark integration and smart defaults
   - Timeline: 16-20 weeks

4. **[Advanced Export Pipeline](plans/advanced-export-pipeline.md)**
   - Business-ready reports and automated stakeholder communication
   - Excel, PowerPoint, dashboard integration
   - Timeline: 18-22 weeks

### ðŸ“‹ **Next Immediate Actions**
- **Strategic Planning Complete** âœ…
- **Prioritize implementation order** based on business value and dependencies
- **Consider parallel development** with 2-3 teams for faster delivery
- **Foundation is solid** - ready for advanced feature development

## Recently Completed âœ…
- **NPM Package Distribution** - Published to npm registry, clean distribution without git artifacts
