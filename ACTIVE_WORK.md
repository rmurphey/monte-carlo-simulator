# Active Work - Monte Carlo Simulation Framework

## Project Status
- **Quality**: Production-ready with bulletproof validation
- **Tests**: All tests passing
- **Templates**: 13 working simulation templates, all schema-validated
- **NPM Published**: Available via `npx monte-carlo-simulator`
- **Distribution**: Clean npm package, no build artifacts in git
- **Date**: 2025-08-13

## Current Priorities

### ðŸš€ **Strategic Enhancement Implementation**
Four strategic plans ready for implementation prioritization:

### ðŸ“‹ **Next Immediate Actions**
- **Address ESLint Warnings** - 143 warnings remaining for code quality improvements
  - Type safety issues (`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`)
  - Code complexity violations (`max-depth`, `complexity`, `max-lines-per-function`)
  - Function length limits exceeded
- **Revisit web view to make sure it works** - Verify interactive web interface functionality

## Recently Completed âœ…
- **Web Interface Testing Suite** - Comprehensive automated tests for Vite development server and web functionality (August 2025)
  - Installed Playwright for browser-based testing and node-fetch for HTTP testing
  - Created `npm run test:web` command for web interface testing
  - Implemented 7 passing tests covering server startup, TypeScript transformation, asset serving, and hot reload infrastructure
  - Added `npm run test:all` to run both framework and web tests
  - Verifies Vite development server works correctly with TypeScript modules and hot reload
