# AI Investment ROI Analysis Simulations

Monte Carlo simulations for analyzing AI tool investment returns over 36 months, modeling implementation risks, adoption challenges, and market uncertainties.

## Simulations

### `baseline.yaml` - Realistic Baseline Scenario
**Balanced risk-return profile for typical AI implementations**

- **Initial Cost**: $50k setup + $5k/month subscription  
- **Implementation**: 6 months expected (can extend to 18 months with delays)
- **Adoption Rate**: 70% chance of successful adoption
- **Revenue Impact**: 15% increase in annual revenue
- **Cost Savings**: $25k annually from efficiency gains

**Use Case**: Standard business case evaluation for mid-market companies

### `conservative.yaml` - Low Risk Scenario  
**Lower cost, higher success probability, modest returns**

- **Initial Cost**: $25k setup + $2.5k/month subscription
- **Implementation**: 3 months expected (quick deployment)
- **Adoption Rate**: 90% chance of successful adoption  
- **Revenue Impact**: 5% increase in annual revenue
- **Cost Savings**: $15k annually

**Use Case**: Risk-averse organizations, pilot programs, budget-constrained implementations

### `aggressive.yaml` - High Risk, High Reward Scenario
**Enterprise-scale deployment with ambitious returns**

- **Initial Cost**: $100k setup + $10k/month subscription
- **Implementation**: 9 months expected (complex integration)
- **Adoption Rate**: 50% chance of successful adoption
- **Revenue Impact**: 30% increase in annual revenue  
- **Cost Savings**: $50k annually from automation

**Use Case**: Large enterprise transformations, competitive differentiation strategies

## Key Risk Factors Modeled

1. **Implementation Delays**: 1-3x longer than planned (realistic project overruns)
2. **Adoption Failure**: 30% effectiveness if adoption fails vs planned benefits
3. **Benefit Variance**: Actual benefits range from 50%-150% of projections  
4. **Market Price Increases**: Subscription costs may increase 1.2-2.5x over time
5. **Competitive Response**: 30% chance competitors reduce your advantage to 70%

## Output Metrics

- **ROI (%)**: Total return on investment over 36-month period
- **Total Cost ($)**: Implementation + subscription costs + price increases
- **Total Benefit ($)**: Revenue improvements + operational cost savings
- **Net Benefit ($)**: Total benefit minus total cost
- **Break-even Month**: When cumulative benefits exceed costs (999 = never breaks even)
- **Risk Score (1-5)**: Algorithmic assessment of scenario risk level

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Run baseline analysis
npm run cli run simulations/ai-investment-roi/baseline.yaml

# Compare all three scenarios  
npm run cli run simulations/ai-investment-roi/conservative.yaml
npm run cli run simulations/ai-investment-roi/baseline.yaml
npm run cli run simulations/ai-investment-roi/aggressive.yaml

# Validate configuration
npm run cli validate simulations/ai-investment-roi/baseline.yaml
```

## Interpreting Results

### Conservative Scenario Example:
```
ROI: 10.7% ± 40%
Break-even: ~33 months
Risk Score: 2.8 (Medium-Low)
```
**Interpretation**: Steady, low-risk returns with high probability of profitability

### Aggressive Scenario Example:
```
ROI: 70.9% ± 125%  
Break-even: ~34 months
Risk Score: 3.7 (Medium-High)
```
**Interpretation**: High potential returns but significant variance and risk

## Business Context Integration

All simulations include automatic business context injection when `businessContext: true`:
- ARR-based budget calculations
- ROI and payback period functions  
- NPV and CAGR calculations
- Customer acquisition cost modeling

## Customization

To create custom scenarios:
1. Copy `baseline.yaml` as starting point
2. Adjust parameter defaults for your specific case
3. Update name, description, and tags
4. Validate with `npm run cli validate`
5. Run analysis with `npm run cli run`
